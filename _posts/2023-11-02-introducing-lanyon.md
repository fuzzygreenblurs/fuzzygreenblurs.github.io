### Blah Blah.

* check out my [About Page](/about).
* check out my [Github](https://github.com/fuzzygreenblurs).
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

Heres a code snippet in Python:

```python
...
def bind_pubsub_callbacks(self):
        super().init_client()
        self.client.on_message = self.on_message
        self.client.message_callback_add(self.client_id, self.cb)
...
```

Here's another one in C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int arr[] = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 };
    int size_arra = (arr, sizeof arr / sizeof *arr);
    printf("Number of elements in arr[]:  %d", size_arra);
}
```

### Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **â˜°** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.
