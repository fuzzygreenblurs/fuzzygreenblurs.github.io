title: Hello.

My name is Akhil and I am a software engineer with a background in mechanical engineering. I am primarily experienced in backend engineering  but am interested in transitioning to software engineering opportunities in motion planning, control and their practical implementation on embedded platforms.

*I am therefore currently pursuing an MS with the Rutgers University Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, specializing in Systems & Control*.

Over the past nine years, I have worked as a software engineer at different layers of the tech stack (from writing bare metal device drivers to supporting cloud orchestration) in the IoT sector. Most recently, I worked as a Robotics Software Engineer with [OpenShelf](https://www.opshelf.com/), testing a variety of sensor integrations and developing an AWS hosted MQTTS bidirectional telemetry pipeline to remotely monitor and control the physical prototype.

As a side quest, I'm interested in how physical phenomena can be rendered and simulated through software. I am currently working on a simple 2D game physics engine (courtesy of the fantastic [Pikuma course](https://pikuma.com/courses/game-physics-engine-programming) on the subject). If you're interested, you can check out this project and some other ones on this site.
