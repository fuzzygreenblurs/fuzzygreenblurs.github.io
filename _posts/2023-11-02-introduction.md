title: Hello.
---
My name is Akhil and I am a software engineer who wields his powers to make stuff move in the physical domain. 

A little bit about myself: over the past nine years, I have worked as a software engineer in the IoT sector. Most recently, I worked as a Robotics Software Engineer with [OpenShelf](https://www.opshelf.com/), testing a variety of sensor integrations and developing an AWS hosted MQTTS bidirectional telemetry pipeline to remotely monitor and control the Openshelf robot prototype. I am currently a graduate student at Rutgers University, pursuing my MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializing in Systems and Control.

As a side quest, I'm interested in how physical phenomena can be rendered and simulated through software. I am currently working on a simple 2D game physics engine (courtesy of the fantastic [Pikuma course](https://pikuma.com/courses/game-physics-engine-programming) on the subject). If you're interested, you can check out this project and some other ones on this site.

### Also I love making new friends! Feel free to [ping me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akhilsankar/) if you ever feel like a coffee and a chat :)
