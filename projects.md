## 2D Physics Engine (Pikuma Course)

Note: all demos in this section are built using vanilla C++17 and SDL2

#### 1. Impulse Collision Resolution

This demo showcases collision detection and resolution using a penetration and impulse calculation of circular objects of different masses at a different coefficients of resitution. In the showcased demo, one object is maintained in a static position (invMass = 0) while new objects are dynamically spawned in the environment, showcasing multiple simultaneous collisions. You can find the code for this specific demo in this [commit](https://github.com/fuzzygreenblurs/2d_game_physics_engine/commit/ba62d30afc7afab7a5d92c4412c0ffd2a9d1d162).
