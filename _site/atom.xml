   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My name is Akhil and I am a software engineer who wields his powers to make stuff move in the physical domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little bit about myself: over the past nine years, I have worked as a software engineer in the IoT sector. Most recently, I worked as a Robotics Software Engineer with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opshelf.com/&quot;&gt;OpenShelf&lt;/a&gt;, testing a variety of sensor integrations and developing an AWS hosted MQTTS bidirectional telemetry pipeline physical robot. I am currently a graduate student at Rutgers University, pursuing my MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializing in robotic systems and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side quest, Iâ€™m interested in how physical phenomena can be rendered and simulated through software. I am currently working on a simple 2D game physics engine (courtesy of the fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://pikuma.com/courses/game-physics-engine-programming&quot;&gt;Pikuma course&lt;/a&gt; on the subject). Check out my posts on this project, and others :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love making new friends! Ping me anytime at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/akhilsankar/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; if you ever want to grab a coffee and talk shop!&lt;/p&gt;
